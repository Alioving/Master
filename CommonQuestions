1. Why do you want to pursue a PhD after five years in industry?
Interviewer’s perspective: They want to understand your motivation for returning to academia, how this decision fits into your career plan, and why you believe a PhD is necessary.

Sample Answer:

“Over the past five years working as a software engineer, most of my responsibilities have focused on meeting business requirements and delivering solutions for various projects. While this practical experience has been valuable, I have felt a growing need to conduct deeper, more systematic research in a specific area. Pursuing a PhD would offer an environment where I can delve into cutting-edge topics and develop innovative approaches. It would also provide the academic rigor and mentorship necessary to push the boundaries of my field. Ultimately, I hope not only to apply technology effectively, but also to contribute to the theoretical underpinnings and methodologies that will advance both industry and academia.”

2. Why did you choose our university and this specific lab for your PhD?
Interviewer’s perspective: They want to see if you have done your homework about the lab’s research and how your background fits.

Sample Answer:

“Monash University is a globally renowned institution known for its strong research impact and academic excellence. While exploring potential PhD programs, I found your lab and research project on the university's official website. The focus of your work closely aligns with my previous research experience, making it an ideal environment for me to contribute effectively while also deepening my expertise. By working in a familiar domain, I can quickly adapt and start making meaningful contributions, ensuring a productive and impactful research journey.”

3. What are your research interests and how do you envision focusing them during your PhD?
Interviewer’s perspective: They want to assess the alignment between your interests and the lab’s work, as well as your understanding of the field.

Sample Answer:

“I am particularly interested in using deep learning and signal processing techniques to improve epileptic seizure detection accuracy and reduce false positives. From my industrial experience, I’ve seen that real-time detection often faces challenges with noisy data and limited processing power. In my PhD research, I’d like to explore more advanced architectures—such as attention-based models or graph neural networks—that could handle these complexities. Ultimately, I aim to develop a robust system that can be clinically viable and beneficial for neurology departments or telemedicine applications.”

4. What kind of research or technical projects have you undertaken in your master’s study or during your employment? What are the outcomes?
Interviewer’s perspective: They’re evaluating your research or project management capabilities and potential to contribute to the lab.

Sample Answer:

“During my master's studies, my research focused on epileptic seizure prediction using machine learning. As a result of this work, I published two journal papers and obtained a Chinese patent related to this research. Additionally, during my internship, I worked on a deep learning-based sleep monitoring project, which also led to another Chinese patent.

At Huawei, my role primarily involved software development, which significantly enhanced my coding and practical engineering skills. This combination of academic research and industry experience has provided me with a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied aspects of machine learning, making me well-prepared for further research in this field. I believe these experiences align well with the requirements of the PhD program and will enable me to contribute effectively.”

5. How do you handle challenges and difficulties in research? Can you give an example?
Interviewer’s perspective: They want to know how you cope with setbacks and solve problems—essential qualities for a PhD candidate.

Sample Answer:

“In one of my recent projects, we struggled with extremely imbalanced data, which caused our model to miss critical events. After extensive literature review, I discovered several techniques like data augmentation and specialized loss functions that could mitigate the imbalance issue. I then collaborated with my team to run a series of experiments, ultimately improving performance metrics significantly. This experience taught me the importance of staying current with the latest research, systematically testing hypotheses, and engaging in collaborative problem-solving.”

6. What is your plan for your PhD study?
Interviewer’s perspective: They want a sense of your structure, goals, and time management approach.

Sample Answer:

“In the first year, I plan to solidify my understanding of state-of-the-art methods in seizure detection, reading extensively on EEG-based machine learning and clinical contexts. Concurrently, I’ll initiate small pilot studies to identify the most promising angle. During the second and third years, I aim to refine a specialized framework—likely involving deep learning or hybrid models—for accurate and efficient seizure detection, with the goal of publishing my findings in reputable conferences or journals. In the final year, I hope to extend the system’s generalizability and explore potential clinical collaborations or real-world pilots, ensuring a strong foundation for post-PhD work.”

7. What are your career plans after earning your PhD? Will you stay in academia or go back to industry?
Interviewer’s perspective: They are curious about your long-term ambitions and how the PhD fits into them.

Sample Answer:

“I see myself continuing research in a capacity that combines academia and industry—possibly through a postdoc or a research-centric role in a tech or med-tech company. I’m drawn to the idea of bridging advanced research and real-world medical applications, especially because machine learning-based seizure detection has so much potential to help patients if properly deployed. If I have the opportunity to teach or mentor others in a university setting while still engaging in practical innovations, that would be ideal.”

8. You’ve been out of academia for five years. Are you concerned about the transition back into research?
Interviewer’s perspective: They might worry if you’re still equipped for the demands of doctoral research.

Sample Answer:

“I understand that the academic environment demands rigorous exploration of theoretical concepts, which may differ from industry priorities. However, I will stayed informed by reading relevant papers, attending webinars, and working on personal side projects related to signal processing. My time as a software engineer also sharpened my problem-solving, time management, and collaboration skills—critical assets for managing a complex PhD project. I’m confident that, with a short period of adjustment and a proactive approach to catching up on cutting-edge theory, I’ll adapt quickly.”

9. How do you plan to communicate and collaborate effectively with your advisor and the research team?
Interviewer’s perspective: They want to gauge how well you’ll fit into the lab’s collaborative environment.

Sample Answer:

“In my previous role, I led cross-functional teams where open communication and consistent feedback loops were essential. I plan to bring the same mindset here: regularly meeting with my advisor, sharing progress updates, discussing roadblocks, and seeking guidance early on to avoid going down unproductive paths. I also look forward to engaging with lab colleagues—especially those with complementary expertise—so we can exchange ideas and accelerate everyone’s research. Team synergy and knowledge sharing are cornerstones of meaningful innovation.”

10. How will you handle the pressure of publishing papers, competition, and potential failures during the PhD?
Interviewer’s perspective: They want to see if you have realistic expectations of the challenges ahead and the resilience to overcome them.

Sample Answer:

“I’m aware that the PhD journey involves high standards, tight deadlines, and sometimes setbacks with experiments or publication rejections. Over the past five years, I’ve learned to break down large projects into manageable milestones and maintain steady progress instead of aiming for perfection all at once. I also find it helpful to seek feedback early, whether from my advisor or peers, to catch issues before they escalate. If something fails, I see it as an opportunity to refine my hypotheses or approach. Maintaining a good work-life balance and staying involved with peers helps me manage stress and remain productive.”
