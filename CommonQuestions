自我介绍

Dear Professor Kuhlmann

I should actually say good evening, because I'm in Europe right now, and the current time is 11:30 p.m. I came here to support the customer's business. 

My name is Hu Wenbin, from China. I graduated from Hangzhou Dianzi University in 2019 with a master's degree in control engineering. After graduation, I have been engaged in software development related work in Huawei Technologies Co., LTD. (the most famous communication company in China and a mobile phone manufacturer). My graduate thesis is the prediction of epileptic seizure based on machine learning, which I believe matches your direction
My partner, Deutsche Telekom, bought some of our company's products such as servers and some other solution products, which need the support of engineers. At present, my main job is to maintain the stability of the live network, update and upgrade the version of the live network system, and solve customers' problems. I've written code, I've done testing, I've done pretty much anything related to software development.

Sample Answer:

“During my master's studies, my research focused on epileptic seizure prediction using machine learning. As a result of this work, I published two journal papers and obtained a Chinese patent related to this research. Additionally, during my internship, I worked on a deep learning-based sleep monitoring project, which also led to another Chinese patent.

At Huawei, my role primarily involved software development, which significantly enhanced my coding and practical engineering skills. This combination of academic research and industry experience has provided me with a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied aspects of machine learning, making me well-prepared for further research in this field. I believe these experiences align well with the requirements of the PhD program and will enable me to contribute effectively.”

================5. How do you handle challenges and difficulties in research? Can you give an example?
Interviewer’s perspective: They want to know how you cope with setbacks and solve problems—essential qualities for a PhD candidate.

Sample Answer:

“In one of my previous projects, we struggled with extremely imbalanced data, which caused our model to miss critical events. After extensive literature review, I discovered several techniques like data augmentation and specialized loss functions that could mitigate the imbalance issue. I then collaborated with my team to run a series of experiments, ultimately improving performance metrics significantly. This experience taught me the importance of staying current with the latest research, systematically testing hypotheses, and engaging in collaborative problem-solving.”

Interviewer’s perspective: They want a sense of your structure, goals, and time management approach.

Sample Answer:

“In the first year, I plan to solidify my understanding of state-of-the-art methods in seizure detection, reading extensively on EEG-based machine learning and clinical contexts. Concurrently, I’ll initiate small pilot studies to identify the most promising angle. During the second and third years, I aim to refine a specialized framework—likely involving deep learning or hybrid models—for accurate and efficient seizure detection, with the goal of publishing my findings in reputable conferences or journals. In the final year, I hope to extend the system’s generalizability and explore potential clinical collaborations or real-world pilots, ensuring a strong foundation for post-PhD work.”

==================7. What are your career plans after earning your PhD? Will you stay in academia or go back to industry?
Interviewer’s perspective: They are curious about your long-term ambitions and how the PhD fits into them.

Sample Answer:

“I see myself continuing research in a capacity that combines academia and industry—possibly through a postdoc or a research-centric role in a tech or med-tech company. I’m drawn to the idea of bridging advanced research and real-world medical applications, especially because machine learning-based seizure detection has so much potential to help patients if properly deployed. If I have the opportunity to teach or mentor others in a university setting while still engaging in practical innovations, that would be ideal.”

=================8. You’ve been out of academia for five years. Are you concerned about the transition back into research?
Interviewer’s perspective: They might worry if you’re still equipped for the demands of doctoral research.

I also find it helpful to seek feedback early, whether from my advisor or peers, to catch issues before they escalate. If something fails, I see it as an opportunity to refine my hypotheses or approach. Maintaining a good work-life balance and staying involved with peers helps me manage stress and remain productive.”


=============== 11.  Research Challenges and Difficulties
"Every research project faces challenges, and our study on epileptic seizure prediction is no exception. Here, I will highlight three key difficulties that impacted our research and discuss their implications."

📌 1. Limited Data Availability
Obtaining high-quality EEG data is difficult, as there are very few publicly available datasets.
Our final dataset contained only around 10,000 samples, sourced from a single public database.
Generalization remains a concern—since our data is limited, the model's performance on unseen clinical data may not be optimal.
Even though we collaborated with hospitals, access to clinical EEG data was very restricted, making it hard to improve model robustness.
This limitation is evident in our clinical trial results, which show a drop in performance when tested on real-world patient data.
📌 2. Computational Constraints at the Time
Five years ago, computing power was far more limited compared to today.
Deep learning models require substantial computational resources, but at that time, high-performance GPUs were not as common or accessible.
This constraint restricted the size of our training dataset and the complexity of our model architectures.
With today’s advancements in hardware, we believe that training on larger EEG datasets would significantly improve model accuracy and generalization.
📌 3. Pre-feature Selection and Model Input Optimization
While CNNs can learn features automatically, our initial approach of using raw EEG signals as input did not yield good results.
EEG signals have complex frequency-domain characteristics, which are not well captured by direct time-domain analysis.
To address this, we explored frequency-domain features:
Converted EEG signals into frequency representations.
Applied basic processing techniques to enhance signal clarity before feeding it into the CNN.
This significantly improved model performance, showing that pre-processing EEG data before deep learning is crucial.
📌 Summary
*"In summary, the three biggest challenges were:

Limited dataset size, leading to generalization issues.
Computational constraints at the time, restricting model training.
Feature selection—shifting from raw EEG signals to frequency-domain transformations improved performance.
As computing power increases and more clinical EEG data becomes available, we believe that future models will achieve much higher accuracy and reliability."*
