"Hello , my name is Wenbin Hu. The topic of my work is 'Prediction of Epileptic Seizures Based on Convolution Neural Network.'  
This research focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to improve the prediction of epileptic seizures. 
By analyzing EEG signals, the model aims to detect patterns that indicate an upcoming seizure, enabling early intervention.  

In the following slides, I will introduce the motivation behind this study, the methodology used, key findings, and potential applications. Letâ€™s get started."

"This slide presents the research background on epilepsy.

Epilepsy is a recurrent and sudden neurological disease affecting about 50 million people worldwide, with a high recurrence rate.
Cause of Epileptic Seizures: They are triggered by hypersynchronous abnormal discharges in the brain.
Manifestations: Symptoms include convulsive movements and temporary loss of consciousness.
Treatment Methods: Current treatments mainly include medication and surgical interventions.
The images below illustrate EEG signals and the electrode placement system used for monitoring brain activity."

"Now, let's talk about the significance of this research.
Epileptic seizure prediction plays a crucial role in improving patient safety and treatment effectiveness. This research focuses on three key areas:
First, the Warning Device. By analyzing EEG signals, we can generate alerts before a seizure occurs. This early warning system allows patients and caregivers to take necessary safety measures in advance, reducing potential risks.
Second, Focal Excision. EEG signals can help accurately locate the nidus, or seizure focus, enabling precise surgical removal. This minimizes surgical damage and improves treatment outcomes.
Lastly, the Method of Administration. By developing a real-time seizure prediction system, we can assist doctors in optimizing treatment plans, reducing their workload, and decreasing patients' dependence on medication.

Overall, this research aims to enhance seizure prediction accuracy, improve medical interventions, and ultimately provide a better quality of life for epilepsy patients."
