"Hello , my name is Wenbin Hu. The topic of my work is 'Prediction of Epileptic Seizures Based on Convolution Neural Network.'  
This research focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to improve the prediction of epileptic seizures. 
By analyzing EEG signals, the model aims to detect patterns that indicate an upcoming seizure, enabling early intervention.  

In the following slides, I will introduce the motivation behind this study, the methodology used, key findings, and potential applications. Letâ€™s get started."

"This slide presents the research background on epilepsy.

Epilepsy is a recurrent and sudden neurological disease affecting about 50 million people worldwide, with a high recurrence rate.
Cause of Epileptic Seizures: They are triggered by hypersynchronous abnormal discharges in the brain.
Manifestations: Symptoms include convulsive movements and temporary loss of consciousness.
Treatment Methods: Current treatments mainly include medication and surgical interventions.
The images below illustrate EEG signals and the electrode placement system used for monitoring brain activity."
